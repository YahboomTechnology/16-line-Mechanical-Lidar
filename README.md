# Introduction
WLR-720 is a 16-line mechanical lidar. It adopts the TOF ranging principle and has a scanning radius of up to 120 meters. It can obtain high-quality original point cloud data within a 30° vertical field of view. It has a built-in 6-axis IMU sensor. Angular velocity and acceleration data can be output and viewed through the host computer. This lidar is mainly used for navigation and positioning of low-speed driving vehicles and robots, as well as outdoor high-precision map drawing and obstacle detection. The lidar adopts automotive-grade production technology, built-in heating module and heat dissipation treatment, excellent light resistance and multiple echoes, etc. Functional design helps driverless vehicles be used in complex environments.
# Features
* 16-line scanning technology, scanning radius 120 meters, scanning frequency adjustable 5Hz/10Hz/20Hz, supports high-quality original point cloud data output within 30° in the vertical direction.
* Yahboom provides routines for 6 3D mapping algorithms: Lego-Loam, Cartographer 3D, Lio-Sam, A-Loam, Liom, and Autoware.ai.
* Built-in 6-axis IMU, and supports external IMU inertial navigation and GPS modules. With Yahboom's IMU inertial navigation module, it can achieve more accurate and detailed mapping navigation functions.
* Complies with Class1 eye-safe laser and has a closed protective cover to better protect the radar and effectively reduce external interference.
